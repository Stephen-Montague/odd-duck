# odd-duck

Coursework for Code Fellows. 

This brief exercise uses a 3'rd party library (chart.js) to display a bar chart, after analyzing user input and storing persistent data in local storage.

See the exercise desployed to GitHub pages [here](https://stephen-montague.github.io/odd-duck/). 

Happy coding.
